# üìö Data Structures & Algorithms in C++ ‚Äì Practice Repository

This repository is a curated collection of my hands-on practice in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**. It demonstrates my understanding and implementation of essential DSA concepts, including **binary trees**, **linked lists**, **queues**, **stacks**, and **circular structures**.

Each program is self-contained, well-commented, and serves as a practical example of a core algorithm or data structure operation. The goal of this repository is to build a solid foundation in DSA, improve coding skills, and prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming.
